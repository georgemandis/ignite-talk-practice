# Ignite Talk Practice Tool

This is a simple timer to help you practice the pacing for your [Ignite talks](http://ignitetalks.io). The format is a 5 minute presentation, 20 slides, each slide auto-progressing every 15 seconds. I hope you find it useful:

I used this to practice for my talk at [Ignite Portland 13](http://igniteportland.org). It helped **a lot!** Particularly because it turns out nothing on my computer would simply present the PDF as an auto-progressing slideshow every 15 seconds.
